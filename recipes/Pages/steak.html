    <p>Skillet Dry-Aged Steak & Scallops is every bit as decadent as it sounds. A gorgeous, dry-aged steak is seared in a hot skillet, basted with butter, herbs and garlic and served with buttery scallops. The flavor of each bite is out of this world and comes together in your own kitchen in one skillet.</p>
    <h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18oz dry-aged bone-in New York Strip Steak</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 fresh rosemary sprigs</li>
        <li>5 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 whole garlic cloves</li>
        <li>6 scallops</li>
        <li>flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a cast iron skillet over high heat. Pat the steak dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Sear the steak presentation side-down first for about 5-6 minutes, or until a golden crust has formed. Then flip the steak to sear on the other side for the same duration. Rotate the steak to then quickly sear and get some color on the boarder-sides of the steak.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, add in the butter, rosemary, thyme and garlic into the pan and swirl to melt the butter. Tilt the pan slightly to allow all the butter to run to one end of the pan and use a spoon to baste the steak with the butter for about a minute or so.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the pan and set aside to allow to rest. It should read about 125-130 degrees for a medium rare steak.</li>
        <li>While the steak is resting, bring the skillet back up to a medium heat. Sear the scallops for several minutes on one side to create a golden brown crust. Then, flip the scallops and cook for another few minutes, basting them in the butter from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Slice the steak and serve with the scallops and garlic butter spooned over the top. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and enjoy!</li>
